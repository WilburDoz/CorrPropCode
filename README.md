# CorrPropCode
These files calculate a curve of correlations before and after passing through a random connectivity matrix, as in Fig 1B of
Schaffer et al. 2018.

The code includes simulations to check the analytics, and that code is heavily based on the code from the original paper - but very edited.

Just run the file starting Mar15 and it will pop out a couple of figures, the second of which is the more important.
